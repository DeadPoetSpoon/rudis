By default, **Rudis** comes without any extensions.
You can choose to read local content, manually add extensions, or include an external repository.

**Rudis** maintains only one official repository; any other repositories are unofficial and have no affiliation with us.

<AddRepoButton/>

<ExtensionsWrapper/>

<script setup>
import AddRepoButton from '@theme/components/AddRepoButton.vue'
import ExtensionsWrapper from '@theme/components/Extensions/ExtensionsWrapper.vue'
</script>
